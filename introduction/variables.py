# To define a variable we have to use "="
# result = 15
# The type()  function is use to determine a variable or expression type
#Example 1
# >>> type(my_nyumber) 
# <class 'int'>
#Example 2
# >>> my_string='Hello'  
# >>> type(my_string)
# <class 'str'>

#Variable names aknowledge
# Lowercase and uppercase letters: a-z and A-Z
# Numbers: 0-9
# Underscores: _
# Variable names must start with a letter or the underscore character and can not start with a number
#Names are case-sensitive

#Examples
# Here are some valid variable names:

# name_1,
# name_2,
# _database_connection
# These are invalid names:

# 1tomany (donâ€™t start with a number)
# my-number (- is not allowed)
# my number (spaces are not allowed)
# And these variables are not the same due to case sensitivity:

# cartTotal
# carttotal

#Note: Use camel case for called classes 
#Preferly don't use camel case for called variables
